InterGov
========

This is a Proof Of Concept (POC) implementation
that shows how edi3.org standards could be implemented.
Specifically, it uses an Inter Government Ledger (IGL)
with a single blockchain channel,
and implements a collection of microservice components
that work together to provide the suite of edi3 REST interfaces.

See DEPLOYMENT.rst and DEVELOPMENT.rst for technical details.
